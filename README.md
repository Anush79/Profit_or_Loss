# Profit_or_Loss
 A non-responsive website to calculate if we are making a profit or loss in the stock market.
 It has three inputs - Initial Price, Current Price and Quantity of stocks.
 It will show the user total profit or loss along with it's percentage.
 I have included special sound effects and animations on 30% or more profit and 50% or more loss. Kindly use desktop view. Have fun
